# REACT-SAMPLES

While studying ReactJS i produced some sample code. This repository contains what i've done so far. Hope this helps someone :)

## Install

I separated this repository in two main sections: `React Only` and `Flux`.

The first contains samples that came while studying ReactJS alone. The seconds, flux + react.

### React-only

Having NodeJS and NPM properly set up, go to `react-only` and run:

```sh
$ npm install
$ gulp build
```

Then start a local server and enjoy :smile:

### Flux

- [x] todo-sample
- [ ] chat-sample

`//TODO` :neckbeard:

### Jest

Needs docs, some stuff already implemented.
